Originally built as an IS school project, but ended up being useful to show some projects I've worked on. Started in plain bootstrap Javascript/CSS/HTML (just adapting content), but today (11/18/23) I switched 
the project to use Angular so I could add components and clean up the code a bit

# Build Steps
1. ```npm run deploy``` - Script that places the build files in the correct place for Github Pages
2. Move the built files out from 'browser' folder and into root docs folder
3. Push to 'main' branch - triggers Circle CI build that deploys to Github pages
